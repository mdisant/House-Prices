# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting


<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## Description

In this Kaggle competition, data scientists are tasked with utilizing advanced regression techniques to predict house prices. The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education, and this file is the main data source to train and evaluate the prediction model on. There are 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. I will utilize advanced regression techniques, including feature engineering, random forests, and gradient boosting.
